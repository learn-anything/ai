# AI

> Tasks done by language models exposed as library functions or HTTP endpoints

Focus is on making AI tasks work together with [Learn Anything](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything.xyz).

Once they work for LA, the tasks can be potentially generalised and exposed as either language function calls or provided as HTTP calls anyone can use.

There is [tasks](tasks) folder where a lot of experiments are made. Read [tasks/readme.md](tasks/readme.md) inside for more information on how to run them.

AI tasks can be extended by community. The other focus of the repo is to be a place to make various ML experiments. Test out various vector dbs, approaches to process or clean data. And more.
