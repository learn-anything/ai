# AI

> Tasks done by language models exposed as library functions or HTTP endpoints

Heavy focus is on making AI tasks work together with [Learn Anything](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything.xyz).

There is [tasks](tasks) folder where a lot of experiments are made. Read [tasks/readme.md](tasks/readme.md) inside for more information on how to run them.

The goal of this repo is for AI tasks to be extendable by community.

## File structure

- [tasks](tasks) - various AI tasks
- [rust](rust) - AI tasks exposed as rust crates

- [python](python) - AI tasks exposed as Python libraries
- [grafbase](grafbase) - hosted GraphQL endpoint to expose AI tasks to be ran
